Public 
The members, methods and classes that are declared public can be accessed from anywhere. 
This modifier doesnâ€™t put any restriction on the access

Private
Private Data members and methods are only accessible within the class,
Class and Interface cannot be declared as private,
If a class has private constructor then you cannot create the object of that class
from outside of the class

Protected
the protected access modifier is similar to default access modifier with one 
exception that it has visibility in sub classes.Classes cannot be declared protected.
.

Default
When we do not mention any access modifier, it is called default access modifier.
The scope of this modifier is limited to the package only. 
This means that if we have a class with the default access modifier in a package, 
only those classes that are in this package can access this class. 
No other class outside this package can access this class
